# Friendship-Lamp
Two lamps that will communicate over internet. 
Communicate with friends over long distances.

In this project we will use the esp8266 and Node MCU. The esp8266 is a microcontroller; a Wi-Fi module that allows control to inputs/outputs similar to an Arduino. NodeMCU is a Firmware on ESP8266. It has Lua based firmware which is used to develop IoT based applications. 
At the time of this project each board is ~$7 dollars. It is a development board targeted for IoT based Applications with open-source Lua based firmware. Some specs include: 
    Microcontroller: Tensilica 32-bit RISC CPU Xtensa LX106
    Operating Voltage: 3.3V
    Input Voltage: 7-12V
    Digital I/O Pins (DIO): 16
    Analog Input Pins (ADC): 1
    UARTs: 1
    SPIs: 1
    I2Cs: 1
    Flash Memory: 4 MB
    SRAM: 64 KB
    Clock Speed: 80 MHz
    USB-TTL based on CP2102 is included onboard, Enabling Plug n Play
    PCB Antenna
    Small Sized module to fit smartly inside your IoT projects

	Note: refer to "NodeMCU_ESP8266_Pinout" for pinout info

The ESP8266 board can be programmed with the Arduino IDE 

Steps:
1. Programming with Arduino IDE
	A. Install Arduino IDE  from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software Or grab altest version.
